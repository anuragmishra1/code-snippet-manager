## Code Snippet Manager

**I utilized create-react-app as the foundation for the application, and subsequently integrated Electron configuration on top of it. Moreover, I incorporated TailwindCSS to enhance the app's aesthetics.**

### Pre-requisites

- NodeJS and NPM should be installed

### To Start the project in dev mode on web

```
  $ npm start
```

### To Start the project in dev mode with electorn app

```
  $ npm run electron-dev
```

### To build electron app for mac

```
  $ npm run electron-pack
```

Once the previous command is executed successfully, you will find a DMG (Disk Image) file at the following location: dist/code-snippet-manager-1.0.0.dmg. This DMG file allows you to install the application on a macOS system.

`Attention: Please take note that I am not a UI developer, hence I created a basic and straightforward user interface to demonstrate the functionality.`
